# Restart Onboarding App 🚀  

### Learning SwiftUI Animations, Haptics & Sound Effects  

This is SwiftUI animation project from the SwiftUI MasterClass, Section 10, where we explored **animations, haptic feedback, and sound integration**. We also learned structuring components properly and improving interactions.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This app features a **smooth onboarding experience** with custom animations, haptic feedback, and sound effects. It also remembers if the user has completed onboarding using `AppStorage`.  

## 🚀 What I Focused On  
- **Component-Based Design:** Reusable and modular SwiftUI views.  
- **Haptic Feedback:** Added tactile responses for better interaction.  
- **Sound Effects:** Integrated audio feedback when actions are performed.  
- **Animations:** Used SwiftUI’s animation system for smooth transitions.  
- **State Management:** Controlled onboarding flow with `@AppStorage`.  

## 🔥 Features  
✅ Interactive onboarding with draggable elements  
✅ Smooth animations with `easeInOut` and `repeatForever()`  
✅ Haptic feedback on button presses  
✅ Sound effects for user actions  
✅ Persistent onboarding state with `AppStorage`
